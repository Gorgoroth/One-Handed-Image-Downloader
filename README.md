# One-Handed Image Downloader
## A mouseless, fast & easy way to save pictures from any website
This is a work in progress

### Intention
This chrome extension should work like this:

It should allow for a VIM like one-handed, home row operation so you can browse and save pictures while stirring your coffee, petting your cat or whatever, I'm not here to judge.

1. Namely, activate extension via shortcut, e.g. CTRL + SHIFT + S
2.
    * If there's only one big image, save it to Download folder
    * else display overlay with thumbs of available images, each with size information, press a to save all, 1 for the first, 2 for the second etc.
3. ???
4. Profit

#### Initial planed features
